# Pawsome Cat Cafe :cat:
This project was created to demonstrate basic understanding of HTML and CSS to design a wesbite. The code for this project displays a mock website for the Pawsome Cat Cafe so that users may browse the menu of the establishment and learn more about the company. Note that this website displays many features that are currently used for **decorative purposes only**, and may not function as expected.
